add model
add attr's to model
firebase -> add model structure  (0:59)
add some data to firebase
add route (plural)
in route, add model hook (return this.store.findAll('<plural>');
handlebars template (plural) <h1>
	loop through and display name
	make sure it runs (4200/<plural>)
	add <ul> to plural template with <li>'s
add route for show page (singular) => plural/singular
in router, add , {path: 'restaurant_id'});
route file can stay as is
test singular hbs to ensure it is showing properly
	<h1>Show Route</h1>
	add {{outlet}} to plural
	test by /plural/1

on singular hbs, after <h1> add Name: model.name, etc
plural, each li becomes a link-to to the show page

move show to right, add flex container etc., 2 flex-items, 2nd has {{outlet}}

create edit route plural/singular/edit

router - replace singular.edit (7:55)
	with this.route('restaurant.edit', {path: ':restaurant_id/edit'});
singular show page, add link-to 'plural.singular.edit' model.id

edit page, <h1> editing singular</h1>
	add name: {{input value=model.name}}
	button {{action 'save'}}

generate controller plural/singular/edit
edit controller, add actions hash
	this.get('model').save();
	this.transitionToRoute('plural.singular', this.get('model.id'));
	prove save works

make pretty  (10:40)
	plural template - remove ul and li's, put remain in div, class singular-item
	same style as chef-item probably
	max-width -> width

link at top menu
	application.hbs, add there ('Plural' 'plural')

exercise:
	3 restaurants (Steaky McSteakHouse, Taco Tuesday, We Will Wok Your World)
